# Rate Your Music Fast Search
This program utilizes command line arguments to quickly search the databases of rateyourmusic.com.

**Update for Feb 2021**
I know RYM recently has gone through a couple of major sitewide updates. These commands should still work though they might not forever as RYM is
continuing to roll out new updates as part of their new development plan and at some point, they might move something around that breaks some
of the functionality here. As part of their development plan features eventually having an API, I am not going to make any updates to this script
until they release the API because using that would open up many awesome features. 

## Usage:
  * Artist Search: rym.py *name of artist/band seperated by spaces*

_**Album Search** will only work for full lengths. Adding every release type is more effort than automating search is worth._

## Purpose:
I use rate your music constantly so to speed up my searching of the website, I created this script to quickly get me to the page I want.

Certain pages benefit from this script more than others however, every option is faster to search from the command line.
Film pages and charts are annoying to get to from the actual website so the script helps a lot in those cases.

This script will benefit you the most if you set a path to it in your bash_profile.
